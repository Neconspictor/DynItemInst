- do not store item parser symbol index since they can change if the script base symbols change 
(e.g. through mod update or a Ninja patch). Use the instance name instead.
When loading the new instances, every dynamic instance gets assigned a new parser symbol. The DII intern class
tracks the current parser symbol index (optionally)
-DII_CreateNewInstance should return the name of the new symbol and not its parser symbol index; 

-A second DII_CreateNewInstance version where the user can specifiy the name for the resulting dynamic item.
This function can fail, if the specified name is already assigned for an existing parser symbol.
Thus we need proper error handling. This second version of DII_CreateNewInstance should return an error code.
(0 = no error, 1 = item couldn't be created)

- A new function that takes the name of an item and returns its parser symbol index.
