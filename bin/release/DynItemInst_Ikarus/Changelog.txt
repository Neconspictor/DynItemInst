Changelog for DynItemInst_Ikarus (v.1.01):

- Library has integrated now a version number. 
   Added function DII_GetLibVersion() to request it;

- Library uses now an own dummy item for saving
  all dynamic instances. Before there was used
  the instance 'ITAR_PIR_L_ADDON' but this implies
  that the user has defined this instance.

- fixed issue that library hooks target functions when it is loaded
  by system.

- updated demo: Now the library version is displayed at screen.
